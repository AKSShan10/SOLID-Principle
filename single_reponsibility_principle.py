'''''
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that:

A class should have only one reason to change.

Explanation:
This means that a class should only have one responsibility or one job. If a class has multiple responsibilities, it becomes tightly coupled, making it harder to modify and maintain.

Why is SRP Important?
Improves Maintainability â€“ Since each class has a clear purpose, changes are easier to implement.

Enhances Readability â€“ Code is more structured and easier to understand.

Reduces Coupling â€“ Modifying one responsibility does not affect another.

Supports Reusability â€“ A well-defined class can be reused in different contexts.

ðŸ‘‰ Here, the Employee class is responsible for:

Salary calculation

Report generation

Database operations

If we need to change the way we save data, we must modify this class, which could also affect other functionalities.
