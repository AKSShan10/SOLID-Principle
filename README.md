# SOLID-Principle
**Single Responsibility Principle:**
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that:

A class should have only one reason to change.

Explanation:
This means that a class should only have one responsibility or one job. If a class has multiple responsibilities, it becomes tightly coupled, making it harder to modify and maintain.

Why is SRP Important?
Improves Maintainability – Since each class has a clear purpose, changes are easier to implement.

Enhances Readability – Code is more structured and easier to understand.

Reduces Coupling – Modifying one responsibility does not affect another.

Supports Reusability – A well-defined class can be reused in different contexts.
